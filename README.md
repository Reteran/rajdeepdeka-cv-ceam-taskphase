The script improc.py outputs a menu showing the current state of the image and several options.

0 is for resetting the image to the original image.

1 and 2 are for decreasing and increasing the brightness respectively of each pixel of the image by 5 units 

3 is for applying a threshold to binarize the image. A prompt appears telling the user to enter the threshold value.

4 is for flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which the user can choose through a prompt.

5 is for rotating the image either clockwise or anticlockwise, which the function executes by taking the transpose of the image matrix and flipping horizontally or vertically for clockwise and anticlockwise respectively

6 is for blurring the image. The user is prompted to enter a kernel size which only accepts odd numbers.
